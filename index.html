        <p>
          I was one of the few people that I know of, was against marriage. I always thought a free man should never have a family. I considered family a weakness. Working to provide for few other people was, to me, another form of emotional slavery. You will have to keep doing as long as you can. Marriage is a mistake.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Then on one fine British summer day, I met someone online on this side of the Atlantic. Couple months later, I, who thought marriage was weakness, got married on a rainy day. Two souls started, what people call a family.
        </p>

        <p>
          Then on another hot summer day in New York, I became a father! I was even skeptical if I could be a loving father to him. And after spending two and a half years with my son and close to five years with my wife, I think the fulfillment that family brings far outweighs every other thing.
